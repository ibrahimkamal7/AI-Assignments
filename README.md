# AI-Assignments
The directory contains some of the work I did for my AI class which includes the following:
* State and Action Representations
* Uninformed Searches: BFS and DFS
* Informed Searches: Algorithm A* (with an admissible heuristic)
* Adversarual Search: Minimax Algorithm
* Reinforcement Learning: Q-Learning and Q-Table

### Note:

All of the assignments are to be run using command line. Different command line options are implemented for each assignment. More information on the command line options can be found in the assignment instructions
